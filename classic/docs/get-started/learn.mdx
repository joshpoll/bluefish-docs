# Learn Bluefish

<div

<div>
In this short tutorial, you'll learn how to use Bluefish to make the planets diagram!

The planets diagram consists of a row of four circles that represent the first four terrestrial
planets. There is box behind them and a label for Mercury. There is also an arrow pointing from the
label to Mercury.

  <Step>

## 1. Make a Circle

It's time to add your first Bluefish component!
The first thing we'll do is draw the planet Mercury.
Replace the `Text` component in the editor with the code below.

```tsx
<Circle cx={20} cy={30} r={15} fill="#EBE3CF" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

### 2. Add the Other Planets

Now we can add the other planets. Append this code below the Mercury circle.

```tsx
<Circle cx={100} cy={30} r={36} fill="#DC933C" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
<Circle cx={160} cy={30} r={38} fill="#179DD7" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
<Circle cx={280} cy={30} r={21} fill="#F1CF8E" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
```

:::info

It's hard to make the circles evenly spaced by hand. See if you can do it!

:::

</Step>
<Step>

## 3. Put Circles in a Row

Instead of placing the circles manually, we can use a `Row` component to position them.
Add the `Row` component to the diagram and put the `Circle`s inside it.

```tsx
<Row spacing={50}>{/* circles go here */}</Row>
```

Then delete the positions (`cx` and `cy`) on the `Circle`s. For example,

```tsx
<Circle cx={20} cy={30} r={15} fill="#EBE3CF" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
```

should become

```tsx
<Circle r={15} fill="#EBE3CF" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
```

:::info

Try changing the spacing or the size of the circles. What happens?

  </Step>
  <Step>

## 4. Add a Background

To add a background, we can wrap the `Row` in a `Background` component.

```tsx
<Background padding={20}>{/* row goes here */}</Background>
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

## 5. Add a Label

Now it's time to add a label to the Mercury circle. So far, we've been building a hierarchical tree
of components. But now we need to reference the circle that's in the row in order to position it.

To do so, we'll first _name_ the circle, then we'll _reference_ it later in the code. To name the
first circle in the row, we'll add an `id` prop to it.

```tsx
<Circle id="mercury" ... />
```

Then we can add a label by making a `Col` with `Text` for the label and a `Ref` to the planet.

```tsx
<Col spacing={20}>
  <Text>Mercury</Text>
  <Ref refId="mercury" />
</Col>
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

## 6. Add an Arrow

Now let's draw an arrow from the label to the planet. To do so, we'll first name the label:

```tsx
<Text id="label">Mercury</Text>
```

Then we'll add an `Arrow` component:

```tsx
<Arrow>
  <Ref refId="label" />
  <Ref refId="mercury" />
</Arrow>
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

## 7. Improve the label spacing.

We want the label to always be outside the background box, but right now the label is spaced
relative to the planet. We can replace the `Col` component with horizontal `Align` and vertical
`Distribute` to position the label more precisely.

First, replace the `Col` component with an `Align`.

```tsx
<Align alignment="centerX">{/* Keep the same children as Col */}</Align>
```

Then we'll name the planets:

```tsx
<Background id="planets" ... >
  ...
</Background>
```

Then add a `Distribute`.

```tsx
<Distribute direction="vertical" spacing={20}>
  <Ref refId="label" />
  <Ref refId="planets" />
</Distribute>
```
