# Learn Bluefish

In this short tutorial, you'll learn how to use Bluefish to make the planets diagram!

The planets diagram consists of a row of four circles that represent the first four terrestrial
planets. There is box behind them and a label for Mercury. There is also an arrow pointing from the
label to Mercury.

:::note You will learn

- How to write a Bluefish specification using JSX.
- How to use common Bluefish elements (like `Circle`) and relations (like `Align`).
- How to use the `Ref` component to reference other components.

# Writing Bluefish Specifications with JSX

:::info

**Bluefish's JSX syntax is only available in SolidJS environments.** If you are working in other environments
like Svelte or Observable, you will instead need to use Bluefish's function syntax.

<!-- See the [function syntax](/docs/function-syntax) page for more information. -->

(This section of the tutorial is based on [React's documentation](https://react.dev/learn).)

:::

To write a Bluefish _specification_ (or _spec_), you typically use _JSX_ syntax. JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that lets
you write HTML-like code in JavaScript. For example, the following is JSX code:

```jsx
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```

We typically call an element like `h1` a _component_. Components are the building blocks of Bluefish
specifications.

JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like `<br />`. Your component also can't return
multiple JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a `<div>...</div>` or an empty
`<>...</>` wrapper:

```jsx
<>
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <br />
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</>
```

Unlike built-in HTML components, Bluefish components are written with capital letters, like `Circle`
or `Row`. Bluefish components can only be used within a Bluefish specification, which is scoped by a
`<Bluefish>` component.

```jsx
<Bluefish>
  <Circle cx={20} cy={30} r={15} fill="#EBE3CF" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
</Bluefish>
```

# Your First Bluefish Diagram

<Scrolly starterCode={learn}>
  <Step showMe={learn1}>

## 1. Make a Circle

It's time to add your first Bluefish component!
The first thing we'll do is draw the planet Mercury.
Replace the `Text` component in the editor with the code below.

```tsx
<Circle cx={20} cy={30} r={15} fill="#EBE3CF" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
```

  </Step>
  <Step showMe={learn2}>

### 2. Add the Other Planets

Now we can add the other planets. Append this code below the Mercury circle.

```tsx
<Circle cx={100} cy={30} r={36} fill="#DC933C" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
<Circle cx={160} cy={30} r={38} fill="#179DD7" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
<Circle cx={280} cy={30} r={21} fill="#F1CF8E" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
```

:::info

It's hard to make the circles evenly spaced by hand. See if you can do it!

:::

</Step>
<Step showMe={learn3}>

## 3. Put Circles in a `StackH`

Instead of placing the circles manually, we can use a `StackH` component to position them.
`StackH` distributes its children horizontally and aligns them vertically.

Add the `StackH` component to the diagram and put the `Circle`s inside it.

```tsx
<StackH spacing={50}>circles go here</StackH>
```

Then delete the positions (`cx` and `cy`) on the `Circle`s. For example,

```tsx
<Circle cx={20} cy={30} r={15} fill="#EBE3CF" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
```

should become

```tsx
<Circle r={15} fill="#EBE3CF" stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />
```

:::info

Try changing the spacing or the size of the circles. What happens?

  </Step>
  <Step showMe={learn4}>

## 4. Add a Background

To add a background, we can wrap the `StackH` in a `Background` component.

```tsx
<Background padding={20}>stackH goes here</Background>
```

  </Step>
  <Step showMe={learn5}>

## 5. Add a Label

Now it's time to add a label to the Mercury circle. So far, we've been building a hierarchical tree
of components. But now we need to reference the circle that's in the stack in order to position it.

To do so, we'll first _name_ the circle, then we'll _select_ it later in the code. To name the
first circle in the row, we'll add a `name` prop to it.

```tsx
<Circle name="mercury" ... />
```

Then we can add a label by making a `StackV` with `Text` for the label and a `Ref` to the planet.
Place this below the `Background` component, but inside the `Bluefish` component.

```tsx
<StackV spacing={20}>
  <Text>Mercury</Text>
  <Ref select="mercury" />
</StackV>
```

  </Step>
  <Step showMe={learn6}>

## 6. Add an Arrow

Now let's draw an arrow from the label to the planet. To do so, we'll first name the label:

```tsx
<Text name="label">Mercury</Text>
```

Then we'll add an `Arrow` component, pointing from the label to the planet. We can place this below
the `StackV` component, but inside the `Bluefish` component.

```tsx
<Arrow>
  <Ref select="label" />
  <Ref select="mercury" />
</Arrow>
```

  </Step>
  <Step showMe={learn7}>

## 7. Improve the label spacing

We want the label to always be outside the background box, but right now the label is spaced
relative to the planet. We can replace the `StackV` component with horizontal `Align` and vertical
`Distribute` to position the label more precisely.

First, replace the `StackV` component with an `Align`.

```tsx
<Align alignment="centerX">Keep the same children as StackV</Align>
```

Then we'll name the planets earlier in the diagram:

```tsx
<Background name="planets" ... >
  ...
</Background>
```

Then add a `Distribute`. We can place this below the `Align` and above the `Arrow`:

```tsx
<Distribute direction="vertical" spacing={20}>
  <Ref select="label" />
  <Ref select="planets" />
</Distribute>
```

  </Step>
