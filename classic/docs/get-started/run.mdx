# Run Bluefish

Welcome to the Bluefish documentation! This page will show you how to run Bluefish if you just want
to get started coding. If you want to learn more about Bluefish, check out our
[tutorial](/docs/get-started/learn).

If you just want to play around with Bluefish, feel free to edit or fork the sandbox below!

(Hint: Try changing the spacing between the planets.)

<CodeEditor code={planets} />

<!-- You can also use the SolidJS REPL: https://playground.solidjs.com/anonymous/9f920dfc-07b3-45d5-9a9f-7d16df92438c. -->

## Run Bluefish on Other Platforms

In other environments, you can still use Bluefish, but without the SolidJS compiler and JSX syntax.
Bluefish components can be used in these environments under the exported `Hyperscript` namespace.

For simple diagrams, the Hyperscript API isn't too different from JSX. For more advanced uses, [read
about the
differences](https://github.com/solidjs/solid/tree/main/packages/solid/h#solid-hyperscript).

### Observable

### Svelte

Here's a starter REPL: https://svelte.dev/repl/1fa5bf8713ac4fc2a991560e50564932?version=4.2.1.

## Install Bluefish Locally

Bluefish is built on [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) and works best in that environment. But it can be used in other environments, too.

### Create a New SolidJS Project

**TODO**

### Add to an Existing SolidJS Project

To add Bluefish to an existing SolidJS project, you can install it with your favorite package manager.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: "npm", value: "npm" },
    { label: "yarn", value: "yarn" },
    { label: "pnpm", value: "pnpm" },
  ]}
>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install @bluefish-js/solid
```

  </TabItem>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @bluefish-js/solid
```

  </TabItem>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
