In this tutorial, we cover how to use conditionals and loops with Bluefish as well as how to make more advanced layouts.

## 1. For Loops

For loops in Bluefish are written with the `For` component. The `For` component takes one prop,
`each`, which is an array of items to loop over. It also takes one child, which is a function that
takes an item from the array and returns a component.

```tsx
<For each={planets}>
  {(planet) => <Circle id={planet.name} r={planet.radius} fill={planet.color} stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />}
</For>
```

:::info

`For` works like `Array.map`, but it's reactive. If the array changes, the `For` component will
update only the items that changed.

:::

  </Step>
  <Step>

### 2. Modifying Properties in a Loop

By using a loop, you can easily change properties of the planets all at once. For example, you can
remove the border by deleting the `stroke-width` and `stroke` props from the `Circle` component.

Try using this definition for each planet instead:

```tsx
<Circle id={planet.name} r={planet.radius} fill={planet.color} />
```

</Step>
<Step>

## 3. Annotate Each Planet

In addition to changing properties of each planet, we can also use `For` loops to add annotations to
each planet. In the previous tutorial, we used this code to add the Mercury label:

```tsx
<Align alignment="centerX">
  <Text id="label">Mercury</Text>
  <Ref refId="Mercury" />
</Align>
<Distribute direction="vertical" spacing={60}>
  <Ref refId="label" />
  <Ref refId="Mercury" />
</Distribute>
<Arrow>
  <Ref refId="label" />
  <Ref refId="Mercury" />
</Arrow>
```

Let's try using a `For` loop to repeat this code for each planet. Replace the code above with this:

```tsx
<For each={planets}>
  {(planet) => (
    <>
      <Align alignment="centerX">
        <Text id="label">{planet.name}</Text>
        <Ref refId={planet.name} />
      </Align>
      <Distribute direction="vertical" spacing={60}>
        <Ref refId="label" />
        <Ref refId={planet.name} />
      </Distribute>
      <Arrow>
        <Ref refId="label" />
        <Ref refId={planet.name} />
      </Arrow>
    </>
  )}
</For>
```

**Uh oh! Something's not quite right...**

  </Step>
  <Step>

## 4. Use `index` to make unique labels.

The problem with the code in the previous step is that we've reused the "label" id. We can fix this
by using the `index` variable that's passed to the function in the `For` component.

```tsx
<For each={planets}>
  {(planet, index) => (
    <>
      <Align alignment="centerX">
        <Text id={`label-${index()}`}>{planet.name}</Text>
        <Ref refId={planet.name} />
      </Align>
      <Distribute direction="vertical" spacing={60}>
        <Ref refId={`label-${index()}`} />
        <Ref refId={planet.name} />
      </Distribute>
      <Arrow>
        <Ref refId={`label-${index()}`} />
        <Ref refId={planet.name} />
      </Arrow>
    </>
  )}
</For>
```

:::info

Unlike the first argument to the function, `index` is a function, so it needs to be called with
parentheses when it's used.

Great! We've now seen some basic usage of the `For` component for loops. Let's take it to the next
level by making some more complex layouts and introducing conditionals.

<Scrolly starterCode={intermediate2}>
  <Step>

## 5. Align the Labels

Even though we've labeled each planet, the labels are unevenly spaced with respect to each other.
Instead of distributing each label relative to each individual planet, let's align the labels to each
other and distribute them as a group.

To start thinking about this, it helps to describe what you want to do in words, and then translate
that to Bluefish code. For example, currently each label is _aligned_ to its planet, _distributed_
60 pixels vertically from that planet, and there is an _arrow_ connecting the label to the planet.

We now want to _vertically align_ the labels to each other, _distribute_ them vertically from the entire
planets row, and _horizontally align_ and draw an _arrow_ from each
label to its planet. First delete the `For` loop from the previous step. Let's start with the
alignment. As with `Row`, `Align` can take multiple children. Let's put all the labels in an `Align`
component:

```tsx
<Align id="labels" alignment="centerY">
  <For each={planets}>{(planet, index) => <Text id={`label-${index()}`}>{planet.name}</Text>}</For>
</Align>
```

Next, let's distribute the labels vertically from the entire planets row. We've already named the
planets row "planets" and the labels grouping "labels," so we can refer to those names in the
`Distribute` component:

```tsx
<Distribute direction="vertical" spacing={40}>
  <Ref refId="labels" />
  <Ref refId="planets" />
</Distribute>
```

Finally, let's horizontally align and draw an arrow from each label to its planet. We can use the
`For` loop again to do this:

```tsx
<For each={planets}>
  {(planet, index) => (
    <>
      <Align alignment="centerX">
        <Ref refId={`label-${index()}`} />
        <Ref refId={planet.name} />
      </Align>
      <Arrow>
        <Ref refId={`label-${index()}`} />
        <Ref refId={planet.name} />
      </Arrow>
    </>
  )}
</For>
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

## 6. Conditionals with `Switch` and `Match`

The arrows seem kind of close to the big planets. Let's use a background instead of an arrow for
planets with a radius more than 30. We can do this with the `Switch` and `Match` components.
`Switch` takes children, which all must be `Match` components. Each `Match` component takes a `when`
prop, which is a boolean. The first `Match` component whose `when` prop is true will be rendered.
Replace the `Arrow` component with this:

```tsx
<Switch>
  <Match when={planet.radius > 30}>
    <Background>
      <Ref refId={`label-${index()}`} />
      <Ref refId={planet.name} />
    </Background>
  </Match>
  <Match when={true}>
    <Arrow>
      <Ref refId={`label-${index()}`} />
      <Ref refId={planet.name} />
    </Arrow>
  </Match>
</Switch>
```

  </Step>

## Next Steps

Congratulations on completing the intermediate tutorial! You can now make more complex layouts with
loops and conditionals.

You are now ready to read some of the more complex examples in the Examples (coming soon)
section. You can also check out the API Reference (coming soon) to learn about all the
components and properties available in Bluefish.

We recommend you take a look at the SolidJS tutorial to learn more about components, signals, and
control flow in Solid: https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/introduction_basics.

You can also check out the Advanced Bluefish (coming soon) tutorial to learn about the layout
system.
