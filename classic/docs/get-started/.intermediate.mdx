:::info

The tutorial assumes you've completed the [Learn Bluefish](/docs/get-started/learn) tutorial.

:::

In this tutorial, we cover how to use loops and conditionals with Bluefish to make more advanced layouts.
Unlike the components in the beginner tutorial, which were unique to Bluefish, control flow components like `For` and `Switch`
are provided by SolidJS and work with Bluefish the same way they work with other SolidJS components.

:::note You will learn

- How to use SolidJS's `For` component to make a component for each item in an array.
- How to use `For`'s `index` argument to make unique names for each component.
- How to use SolidJS's `Switch` and `Match` components to conditionally render components.

## 1. For Loops

For loops in Bluefish are written with the `For` component. The `For` component takes one prop,
`each`, which is an array of items to loop over. It also takes one child, which is a function that
takes an item from the array and returns a component.

```tsx
<For each={planets}>
  {(planet) => <Circle name={planet.name} r={planet.radius} fill={planet.color} stroke-width={3} stroke="black" />}
</For>
```

:::info

**How is `For` different from `Array.map`?**

`For` works like `Array.map`, but it's reactive. If the array changes, the `For` component will
update only the items that have changed.

:::

:::note

`For` is a SolidJS component, not a Bluefish component. It will work outside of the `<Bluefish>` tag.

:::

  </Step>
  <Step>

### 2. Modifying Properties in a Loop

By using a loop, you can easily change properties of the planets all at once. For example, you can
remove the border by deleting the `stroke-width` and `stroke` props from the `Circle` component.

Try using this definition for each planet instead:

```tsx
<Circle name={planet.name} r={planet.radius} fill={planet.color} />
```

</Step>
<Step>

## 3. Annotate Each Planet

In addition to changing properties of each planet, we can also use `For` loops to add annotations to
each planet. In the previous tutorial, we used this code to add the Mercury label:

```tsx
<Align alignment="centerX">
  <Text name="label">Mercury</Text>
  <Ref select="Mercury" />
</Align>
<Distribute direction="vertical" spacing={60}>
  <Ref select="label" />
  <Ref select="Mercury" />
</Distribute>
<Arrow>
  <Ref select="label" />
  <Ref select="Mercury" />
</Arrow>
```

Let's try using a `For` loop to repeat this code for each planet. Replace the code above with this:

```tsx
<For each={planets}>
  {(planet) => (
    <>
      <Align alignment="centerX">
        <Text name="label">{planet.name}</Text>
        <Ref select={planet.name} />
      </Align>
      <Distribute direction="vertical" spacing={60}>
        <Ref select="label" />
        <Ref select={planet.name} />
      </Distribute>
      <Arrow>
        <Ref select="label" />
        <Ref select={planet.name} />
      </Arrow>
    </>
  )}
</For>
```

But this code doesn't quite work. The problem is that we've reused the "label" name.

  </Step>
  <Step>

## 4. Use `index` to make unique names for each planet.

The problem with the code in the previous step is that we've reused the "label" id. We can fix this
by using the `index` variable that's passed to the function in the `For` component.

```tsx
<For each={planets}>
  {(planet, index) => (
    <>
      <Align alignment="centerX">
        <Text name={`label-${index()}`}>{planet.name}</Text>
        <Ref select={planet.name} />
      </Align>
      <Distribute direction="vertical" spacing={60}>
        <Ref select={`label-${index()}`} />
        <Ref select={planet.name} />
      </Distribute>
      <Arrow>
        <Ref select={`label-${index()}`} />
        <Ref select={planet.name} />
      </Arrow>
    </>
  )}
</For>
```

:::info

Unlike the first argument to the function, `index` is a function, so it needs to be called with
parentheses when it's used.

Great! We've now seen some basic usage of the `For` component for loops. Let's take it to the next
level by making some more complex layouts and introducing conditionals.

<Scrolly starterCode={intermediate2}>
  <Step>

## 5. Align the Labels

Even though we've labeled each planet, the labels are unevenly spaced with respect to each other.
Instead of distributing each label relative to each individual planet, let's align the labels to each
other and distribute them as a group.

To start thinking about this, it helps to describe what you want to do in words, and then translate
that to Bluefish code. For example, currently each label is _aligned_ to its planet, _distributed_
60 pixels vertically from that planet, and there is an _arrow_ connecting the label to the planet.

We now want to _vertically align_ the labels to each other, _distribute_ them vertically from the entire
planets row, and _horizontally align_ and draw an _arrow_ from each
label to its planet. First delete the `For` loop from the previous step. Let's start with the
alignment. As with `Row`, `Align` can take multiple children. Let's put all the labels in an `Align`
component:

```tsx
<Align name="labels" alignment="centerY">
  <For each={planets}>{(planet, index) => <Text name={`label-${index()}`}>{planet.name}</Text>}</For>
</Align>
```

Next, let's distribute the labels vertically from the entire planets row. We've already named the
planets row "planets" and the labels grouping "labels," so we can refer to those names in the
`Distribute` component:

```tsx
<Distribute direction="vertical" spacing={40}>
  <Ref select="labels" />
  <Ref select="planets" />
</Distribute>
```

Finally, let's horizontally align and draw an arrow from each label to its planet. We can use the
`For` loop again to do this:

```tsx
<For each={planets}>
  {(planet, index) => (
    <>
      <Align alignment="centerX">
        <Ref select={`label-${index()}`} />
        <Ref select={planet.name} />
      </Align>
      <Arrow>
        <Ref select={`label-${index()}`} />
        <Ref select={planet.name} />
      </Arrow>
    </>
  )}
</For>
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

## 6. Conditionals with `Switch` and `Match`

The arrows seem kind of close to the big planets. Let's use a background instead of an arrow for
planets with a radius more than 30. We can do this with the `Switch` and `Match` components.
`Switch` takes children, which all must be `Match` components. Each `Match` component takes a `when`
prop, which is a boolean. The first `Match` component whose `when` prop is true will be rendered.
Replace the `Arrow` component with this:

```tsx
<Switch>
  <Match when={planet.radius > 30}>
    <Background>
      <Ref select={`label-${index()}`} />
      <Ref select={planet.name} />
    </Background>
  </Match>
  <Match when={true}>
    <Arrow>
      <Ref select={`label-${index()}`} />
      <Ref select={planet.name} />
    </Arrow>
  </Match>
</Switch>
```

  </Step>

components and properties available in Bluefish.

We recommend you take a look at the SolidJS tutorial to learn more about components, signals, and
