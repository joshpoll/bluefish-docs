# What Is Bluefish?

**Bluefish** brings the power of user-interface component design to diagramming. Diagrams are not
UIs. Diagrams need nested coordinate systems. Diagrams need overlapping element hierarchies.
Diagrams need expressive layouts.

Bluefish extends UI concepts you're already familiar with to make diagramming on the web easier.
Bluefish provides **graph-structured component hierarchies** and a **flexible layout architecture.**
