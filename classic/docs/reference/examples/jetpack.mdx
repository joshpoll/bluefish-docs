# Jetpack UI

Jetpack Compose Sleep App example taken from Android's docs on custom layouts:
https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/custom

In Jetpack, this example requires a custom layout in their low-level API. But since Bluefish supports overlapping relations, you don't need to write a low-level layout to
implement this example.
