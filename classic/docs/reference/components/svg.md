# SVG

The SVG component is a top-level component and initiates the layout of Bluefish components. 


It contains the following properties: 

`width` - the overall width of the SVG

`height` - the overall height of the SVG

An example of the syntax looks like this:
```tsx
<SVG width={500} height={500}>
<SVG>
```
