# Group

The Group component groups its children components together. It automatically assigns the `left` and `top` values of its children, if they are not already defined within the children.

An example of the syntax looks like this:
```tsx
<Group>
    <OtherComponent1/>
    <OtherComponent2/>
</Group>
```
